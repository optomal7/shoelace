Stage 1: Reverse Engineer Bootstrap Components

 Styles include replicas of Bootstrap‚Äôs typography:
 Headings
 Body copy
 Addresses
 Blockquotes
 Styles include replicas of Bootstrap‚Äôs buttons
 Components include replicas of Bootstrap‚Äôs:
 Button Groups: Toolbar
 Breadcrumbs
 Pagination
 Labels
 Badges
 Jumbotron
 Page Header
 Thumbnails
 Alerts
 List Group
 Panels
 Wells
 Each component is featured on the demo HTML page demo.html under its own header along with the code used to generate it (for a simple example of what this could look like, see https://purecss.io/buttons/)
Stage 2: Modify the Styles

Now it‚Äôs time to make it look good üòé. Make changes to the CSS (not the HTML) to apply your own styles to the design.

 Demo page demo.html shows components/elements with customized styles, including (but not limited to):
 A different typeface (take a look at Google Fonts for inspiration)
 A unique and different color palette (take a look at Adobe Color CC for inspiration)
 Style should be cohesive, connecting the elements as a whole. For example, a similar color palette is chosen.
Stretch

 Demo page for stylized components is published as a GitHub Pages site
 Site includes instructions for how to include and use your framework
